Today, he explains about the challenges faced on GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL 2.\nI met James Gunn as I was finishing up on AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON, and we talked about GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL 2, and what he wanted to do differently than the first one; we talked about him wanting to surprise the audience all over again, but also to get to know all the characters better, including Rocket and Groot\u2019s new persona, Baby Groot.\nHow was the collaboration with director James Gunn?\nJames was excellent to work with; he knew what he wanted and he had a clear idea of how to get there. He\u2019s a very visual storyteller, and with that, and knowing his characters inside out, he was very clear with his direction.\nHe warned me at the very beginning that the department he was most hard on was visual effects, so I was very aware that our job was going to remain a challenge right to the bitter end! So much of the movie depends on the the visuals of the film, from two of the main characters who are entirely computer generated, to the massive array of spectacular virtual worlds; we had to get it right, in order for the film to work.\nHow did you approach a show with so many VFX shots?\nWe take it one sequence at a time, breaking those up into individual shots. You have to have an overview, but at the same time have to break the film into bite sized pieces; looking at a film which is over 2 hour long, and only has about 60 non VFX shots, and over 2300 VFX shots, from character work to huge environments, from makeup fixes to virtual set rebuilds, can be overwhelming at first. But when approached as many many individual creative challenges, then it becomes more manageable.\nWe pick VFX vendors because of their strengths, from their character work, environment work, simulation work, and their capacity and working styles. Ultimately, we look for the best companies that can work as our partners, creating the most beautiful imagery.\nSplitting the work is always tricky, particularly on this one. Our two main CG characters, Rocket and Groot appear throughout the film, in many different sequences. Because of that, we realized very early on that not one single VFX company could do the all the character work. We assessed the script, broke it down and determined that the best approach was to split it among four different vendors, so that we could share the work load. Framestore, who created Rocket for the first film, took that model and rebuilt him from the ground up, paying particular attention to the facial structure, so that he could annunciate more clearly and be more expressive. They also created Baby Groot, then created character asset packages and shared those with Weta Digital, Method Studios and Trixter; Framestore worked closely with the other companies, taking input as to how best to share the characters, and everyone was very pleased with the results, being able to quickly bring them into very different pipelines, and getting them working very quickly.\nI always rely on very strong supervisorial teams at the different companies, both the VFX Supervisor and Animation Supervisor, along with the CG and Sequence Supervisors. I often work with the same teams again and again, on different films, as we all need a shorthand. I need to have trust in them all, and I always welcome their ideas and input creatively. My job is to act as a conduit to the other film makers, the Director and the Producers, so I need to guide the VFX companies, to get the Director what he or she wants.\nIt takes a really great production team to make things run smoothly, when dealing with so many companies in so many time zones. We try and assign a coordinator to one or two different companies, and it\u2019s their responsibility to act as the day to day production liaison, making sure that we distribute the information efficiently, and have the shots back, ready for review. I\u2019m in cineSync sessions, video and phone conferencing most of my day, reviewing the work from around the world and giving notes.\nCan you tell us more about the previz process?\nPrevis is hugely important; we use it to figure out action beats, camera angles, editorial timing, production design requirements, set builds, methodology breakdowns and scope of work. It\u2019s one of the most valuable parts of the process. The director and I will often sit with the Previs supervisor (in this case, Jim Baker from The Third Floor), and describe the scene; in this case, James was very specific and TTF often went off of James\u2019 stick boards or proper storyboards.\nLet\u2019s talk about the now iconic characters of Rocket and Baby Groot. What was your approach with them?\nWe had a lot to go on from the first movie, but I was keen to add another layer of realism, particularly to Rocket. Their characters had already been established, which was a great starting point, but I wanted to make Rocket feel more alive, more animalistic and more believable, so we worked very hard on that.\nWith Baby Groot, on the other hand, we tried to keep him as an alien twig creature, without falling too far into the cute, anthropomorphic, toddler that he could so easily become; we never needed to add to his cuteness in his animation as he was inherently cute from the start; we had to remember to keep him Buster Keaton neutral, and never to have him overact.\nThe opening title sequence is focusing on Baby Groot. Can you tell us more about his creation?\nThe opening title sequence was a massive undertaking. We prevised the entire shot, based on James\u2019 script and stick boards; we really wanted to create a unique title sequence, but one that immediately immersed the audience back into the Guardians universe, showing the humor, the color, the music and the juxtaposition of form, scale and drama. It was incredibly tricky to hit all the beats, showing this crazy action going on behind Baby Groot as he dances joyously in the foreground, oblivious to it all, all in one single fluid camera move. The Third Floor worked for months on the sequence, initially in previs, and then after, once we\u2019d shot the individual live action elements, in postvis. We also had to allow space and time for the titles, which originally were more integrated into the environment; however, during final shot production, we found that the shallow depth of field caused too many problems when they were fully integrated, because they became unreadable, and not really taken in \u2013 not really very good for a title sequence! In the end we opted for more traditional overlaid titles as they were more readable and didn\u2019t visually compete with the action.\nFor the Baby Groot\u2019s animation, we shot James a couple of times as a reference, as he was very clear about how he wanted the character to be; the first time was during principal photography where we filmed him giving some basic dance moves. Framestore then took that as inspiration and blocked in some movements for Groot. Once we had the general timing, we reshot James, during post production, and had him give us some very specific moves and timings, dancing to the music. Armed with that, Framestore continued to refine the animation, often filming their own animators to work out even more specific actions. It was a shot that ultimately is about three minutes long, and we started work on it early in pre production, and it was one of the last shots to final!\nWhich references and indications did you received for Baby Groot and his behavior?\nJames Gunn was very specific on how he wanted Baby Groot to act, and was always incredibly insightful about his performances. We often referred to Groot from the first film, as a reference and guide as to his textural qualities and movement, and extrapolated that back to how a young version of that would be. I also pointed at the simplistic yet incredibly expressive animations from early Aardman pieces like Creature Comforts; they captured exquisite performances using minimalist movements which were a great guide to the underplayed performance we were going for with Baby Groot.\nHow was simulated the presences of Rocket and Baby Groot on-set?\nSean Gunn, James\u2019 brother who also plays the part of Kraglin, one of the Ravagers, performed as Rocket on set. He\u2019s a very flexible guy, and was able to squat down to Rocket\u2019s height. He performed as Rocket, giving the other actors in the scene something to act with. Once we\u2019d got the shot with Sean, he\u2019d step out and we\u2019d play the scene again, with him just saying the dialogue off camera; this was usually the take we\u2019d use in the film. However, I asked James to treat Sean\u2019s performance as carefully as he would every other actor, ensuring that he got the subtly, nuances, correct gesturing, timing and attitude from Sean; we relied on Sean to give us a single, grounded performance that was the basis for all the different animators to work with, and that allowed us to have a consistent single \u2018voice\u2019 for the character throughout the film. Of course, the actual voice is that of Bradley Cooper, who we shot several times throughout the process, on ADR stages, with head mounted camera rigs and reference cameras so that we could really study lip-sync and the facial performance that he brought to the character.\nIn terms of Baby Groot, we had a life sized (well, 10 inches tall!) maquette that we\u2019d \u2018walk\u2019 through the set, as camera lineup, and lighting reference, but otherwise we literally just used a twig as an eyeline reference for the actors. Occasionally, we\u2019d also have them hold a small, soft, blue screen form, so that we could get the correct physical presence for their hands etc.\nThe movie is taking us to various exotic places. Which one was the most complicated to created and why?\nPlanet Ego was a huge challenge; it\u2019s a world which had to be spectacularly beautiful and stunning, had to look like nothing you\u2019ve ever seen before, had to look absolutely alien but have enough familiarity that it was totally real and believable. We were adamant going in that we didn\u2019t want it to look like a real place on earth that had just been enhanced, so we realized very quickly that the worlds would have to be almost entirely virtual. We wanted a world that was based on a Mandelbrot organically grown, mathematically ordered logic, something that Ego has manufactured but that still has a feeling of natural life to it. We worked very closely with Production Designer Scott Chambliss, and his Art Department, and used much of their concept art as the basis of our worlds. Based on the complexity and scale of the sequence, we also realized that we\u2019d have to share the creation amongst several different VFX companies. Method created the first views of the planet, when we first arrive and the Guardians are welcomed to his world, Scanline VFX created the different surface world where Nebula attacks Gamora as she escapes deeper into the planet, and Weta created the underground world for the final battle.\nWhat was the real size of the sets for Planet Ego?\nWe estimated that all in all, Planet Ego in its various states, used about half a trillion polygons!\nHow did you approach the final sequence inside Planet Ego?\nBased on James\u2019 script, stick boards and the story boards, we started prevising the scene with previs supervisor Jim Baker and his team of incredibly talented artists at The Third Floor. The process is one of evolution; sometimes something that an animator would do would inspire an idea for a different action beat, sometimes it was just a matter of refining a move until it was something that James\u2019 had very specifically envisioned, sometimes the storyboards would be so clear that it was really just a matter of putting them into action. We would then take the edited previs, and with all the various Heads of Department, figure out what could be shot, how to use stunts, practical effects, sets, costumes, what we would try and shoot and what we knew would have to be all digital. We\u2019d discuss with the VFX vendor, the sequences, and talk about how best to get the imagery that we needed. We decided that much of the shoot would have to be done on blue screen stages, indoors, so that we could control the lighting better, but on dressed set pieces whenever we could; we wanted to give the actors as much environment help as possible so that the performances would be as real and visceral as possible, so opted to not just shoot in a big blue box whenever possible. However, even though the sets were often quite large, they were still tiny relative to the vastness of the final environments. After shooting what we could, we\u2019d postvis with that, recut the scene then turn that over to the VFX vendor, and give a creative brief on what we wanted.\nWe challenges were very varied on this film; we wanted to create never before seen worlds (I know, clich\u00e9!), keeping in the same crazy colored vein as the first film, take audiences to places that they didn\u2019t expect, surprise them with the juxtaposition of scenes and environments, and create CG characters that were as part of the ensemble as all the other real actors.\nAnd as there were so many shots (over 2300), and the post production schedule relatively short considering the complexity (about 8-9 months), we had to split the work amongst many VFX vendors (Weta, Framestore, Method, Trixter, Scanline, Animal Logic, Lola, Cantina Creative, Luma, Technicolor and an InHouse team) and keep the work to a consistently high standard so that the audience was never taken out of the film. Even in an effects heavy feature as this, ultimately the film is all about character and story; our work has to be seamless and never be too shouty or too self aware.\nThis film was a real blast to make; it was a lot of hard work and incredibly long hours, but hopefully the fun we had is up on the screen. The artistry in the film is representative of the individual VFX artists throughout the world, who put their hearts and souls into the imagery; from the world builders, the animators, the painters, the modelers, the lighters, the programers, the compositors, and all the production crews in all the different companies, everyone gave of themselves, and it\u2019s that passion which is what I love about making a film like this.\nWe were a team of about 15 people on the production side, and a huge thanks go out to all of them. Creating VFX for a show like this, with so many moving parts, takes an amazing production and coordination effort and without the incredible talents of people like Damien Carr, Tyler Cordova and all the Coordinators, VFX Editors, and entire production crew, we wouldn\u2019t get anything up on the screen!"}, {"inputs": "Today marks the 90th Birthday of Queen Mother Ratna of Nepal, who is the most popular member of the recently abolished monarchy. To mark the day, we are taking a look at the glittering Nepalese Diamond Tiara.\nThis glittering Tiara, of Art Deco design, was first seen on Queen Ratna at King Mahendra\u2019s Coronation in 1956, and she was crowned using the piece. The structure of the piece seems like it was a new acquisition at the time, or might have been inherited by Queen Ratna\u2019s predecessor (and sister), Crown Princess Indra , or her mothers-in-law, Queen Kanti and Queen Ishwari, though I have not found any photographic evidence.\nQueen Ratna wore the Nepalese Diamond Tiara at glittering State Banquets and Galas on State Visits at home and abroad, including a State Visit to Britain in 1960 and the Return Visit by Queen Elizabeth II the following year.\nIn 1972, Queen Ratna passed the Nepalese Diamond Tiara to her daughter-in-law, Queen Aishwarya, who was crowned with the piece at the Coronation of King Birendra in 1975.\nThe Nepalese Diamond Tiara become Queen Aishwarya\u2019s trademark Tiara, worn for glittering Official Portraits and State Visits from Britain and Spain. In 2001, Queen Aishwarya was among the 10 members of the family allegedly killed by her son, Crown Prince Dipendra, and was the last Queen to be pictured in the piece. Her successor, and sister, Queen Komal was also shot during the massacre and was in hospital at the time of her husband\u2019s Coronation, and was also not pictured in the Nepalese Diamond Tiara during her short tenure as Queen, instead preferring a personal Tiara. The present whereabouts of the Tiara are unknown, but it is probably with Queen Ratna, who resides her private house in the former Royal Palace. Hopefully we will see the Tiara soon on other members of the family, preferably Crown Princess Himani Shah.\nUPDATE- The Nepalese Diamond Tiara has gone on display at the Narayanhiti Palace Museum, the former home of the Royal Family, along the magnificent King\u2019s Crown, scepter and sword. Like the Crown and Regalia, it is presumed that the Tiara has been kept at the Palace since the fall of the Monarchy ten years ago, and belongs to the State rather than the Royal Family.\n2960? My goodness who is this writer who can see so far into the future?"}, {"inputs": "Just like last year, there's a lot of Oscar-nominated animation in 2011. And, like last year, an animated film has been nominated for Best Picture, outside of the Best Animated Feature category. And this is as it should be. Especially since the same film was the highest grossing film of 2010 and doesn\u2019t money talk in Hollywood? Maybe next year, two animated films will be nominated in the Best Picture category.\nDoesn\u2019t that tell you something, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences? Animation doesn\u2019t really need a separate category. It never did. The only reason one was created in 2001, was because live actors were outraged in 1991, when they found themselves competing with cartoons after Beauty and the Beast became the first ever animated film nominated in the category.\nBut I haven\u2019t heard many actors bitching about competing with a cartoon lately. Many of the A-list actors nominated for Best Actor/Best Supporting Actor Oscars have done highly-paid voice-overs for animated films and are as beloved for their live roles as for their animated characters.\nHaving a separate category for animation diminishes it and relegates it to a \u201cnot-quite-as-good-as the-real-thing\u201d category. There\u2019s no reason why animation should be considered the exclusive medium of children\u2019s films, therefore not to be taken seriously. This condescension seems to come from a time when animation was so primitive that it could do little more than make us smile with its silliness, not necessarily a bad thing. But, times have changed. Today\u2019s animation is a very sophisticated art, involving not only highly educated and talented writers, artists and designers but even physicists who make the tools the animators use to make magic (light models, virtual clothes).\nAudiences don\u2019t identify with animated characters any less than live actors these days, either. They care just as much about Andy and his toys, Hiccup and Toothless as they do about Colin Firth and Natalie Portman.\nAnd let\u2019s not forget that animation has invaded live-action film to an astonishing degree. There are few, if any live-action films untouched by CGI in one way or another today. From merely digitally removing the nose hairs of a star, to the explosions and crashes and mind-boggling landscapes of Inception, CGI is everywhere in \u201creal\u201d films.\nSo, members of the Academy, why have a separate category for animation? Really, it\u2019s just plain silly. Animation and live-action have a symbiotic existence now, they\u2019re inextricably linked. Let\u2019s just have one Best Picture category and may they best pixel, er, picture win.\nEvery year, I'm torn about this. On the one hand, I completely agree with you that animation doesn't need to be treated as something separate and lesser. Plus, now that there are ten Best Picture nominees and having an animated film among them seems to be a regular thing, it's a disincentive for anyone to vote for the animated film to win Best Picture. Why bother, when you can honor the film with a Best Animated Feature award?\nBut on the other hand, I do like the attention that it brings to animation, particularly when a smaller, less well known film gets nominated. The Illusionist and The Secret of Kells wouldn't have a prayer of being nominated for Best Picture, not because they aren't good, but because they won't have a big studio campaign behind them. These are the kind of films that truly benefit from the existence of a Best Animated Feature Oscar and the boost in publicity that comes from a nomination.\nI'd love to see an animated film win Best Picture someday, but I'm not ready to lose the benefits that comes from the Best Animated Feature award either.\nThe Academy really should call the category what it is: Best Children's Film.\nAnimation is sophisticated enough now to tackle any subject\u2013\u2013Waltz with Bashir and Persepolis have proved that\u2013\u2013so it can properly compete for Best Picture.\nI think i have the same opinion as \"Ink and Pixel Club\" and you.\nAnimation is just a way of telling a story, not a genre. It's an artistic choice, as the choice of filming in B&W would be. And there is no B&W category as far as i know.\nOutstanding movies have been made in animation, telling political, historical, war, comedy, or even action stories, such as Persepolis and Waltz with Bashir as you said, or Fantastic Mr Fox and The Incredibles. Spirited Away even won a Golden Berlin Bear, and it was in competition with live features.\nSo i completely agree that the Animation Feature category shouldn't be necessary, especially when you see it's mainly a Best Children's Film category indeed.\nHowever, as Ink and Pixel Club said, this category is probably the only chance for not-very-well-known movies to get some attention. They created the same category in Les C\u00e9sar (the French cinema awards) for the first time this year, and i think it's a good thing. The Oscar nomination and the Cesar prize of The Illusionist will hopefully bring some new peoples to see it, especially in France where it hasn't been well promoted at all.\nThat's why it would be quite difficult to remove this category for now, when people mostly consider animation as \"for kids\". Yes, Disney or Pixar movies have probably won enough respect now to make it to the Best Picture category. But would Spirited Away have been ever mentioned in 2002, and would Ghibli movies have got so much focus and highlight in the US without the Best Animated Feature award? I'm not absolutely sure about that.\nThanks for your interesting comments, Benjamin.\nI\u2019m flabbergasted that The Illusionist wasn\u2019t well promoted in France. Is this because it was produced mainly in Scotland? Or because of Tati\u2019s shameful behavior toward his \u201cillegitimate\u201d daughter?\nI don\u2019t know that we need the Oscar for exposure of new animated films, there is plenty of exposure on YouTube and Twitter, which is where I learned about L\u2019Illusioniste.\nAs you say, animation is a medium in which any story can be told. Persepolis runs 95 minutes and is rarely dull and Waltz With Bashir runs 86 minutes, a similar length to most animated comedies, so length is obviously not a problem for serious subjects such as war, political oppression and massacres. It\u2019s just a shame that no US animators have dared to try this and, until they do, there won\u2019t be an animated Best Picture Oscar winner. I fear it\u2019s a problem of profit. Especially for ha-animated films, as were Waltz and Persepolis.\nNot that a serious animated feature needs to be about such dire subjects, just something adult. I think its an ideal medium for drama of all kinds. Just think, you could do Kafka\u2019s Metamorphosis brilliantly in animation and all kinds of magical realism, not to mention moody art-deco, noir and spy stuff.\nThis is too adventurous for Pixar and Disney. It would have to be tackled by a brave and talented indie studio, unafraid of not making vast profits. Their successes would be followed by the corporations.\nPerhaps the \"Best Animated Feature\"\ncould be renamed \"Best Feature\" and the best \"Best Picture\" category could be renamed to \"Best non-animated picture\"?\nDon't forget \"The Lost\" thing which won Best Short Animated film.\nYes, why not? I do like the sound of: Best non-animated picture, heh.\nBut you raise an important point: shorts, both animated and not, Every couple of years, the Academy tries to have this category eliminate, unable to see that it's where the Best Pictures come from. Shorts are the incubators, stepping-stones to feature-length films and must be encouraged and rewarded.\nBest Animated Feature guarantees that an animated movie will win an Oscar. If this category is gone, then animated movies can only hope to win technical awards. Why is it so bad that there's a Best Animated Feature Oscar anyway? The whole reason we want our favorite movies to win awards is because we want them to have recognition, and having a dedicated category ensures an award for an animation every year. If Animations could only contend in Best Picture, they would win rarely.\nThe only reason animations get nominated for best picture is because there are 10 nominees, and they need to fill the bill (proof: Alice in Wonderland was nominated!) Animations don't really have a serious chance at winning because live-action bias still exists.\nAnimators don't get nominated for Best Director. No animation has even been nominated for best cinematography, editing, art direction, etc. Animated movies need to be recognized in these categories as well if they are meant to be taken on the same level as live-action films.\nIt is unlikely that the best animated category will be dissolved because the Oscars are a TV show, and like any TV show, their prime goal is to make money. Having an extra award means more commercial breaks, which means more sponsors, which means more money.\nROSS, if you attach an ID to your name, I'd be happy to publish your comment.\nYou know who I am, I'd like to know who you are.\nI thought I included personal information.

An American presidential system as such does not exist. The American government is organized around a shifting power relationship between the president and Congress. For about one century and a half (from the founding of the federal republic to the 1930s), that power relationship was in favour of the Congress (hence the definition of the American government as a \u201ccongressional government\u201d),and after that period the same power relationship shifted in favor of the president (hence the definition of the American government as a \u201cpresidential government\u201d). Although at this point the pre-eminence of the president seems irreversible, the constraints of the separation of powers are still effective. These constraints, combined with a government quasi-permanently divided along party lines made it very difficult for the president to play his preeminence vis \u00e0 vis the Congress. In sum, for those who look for effective government, in the United States presidentialism is the problem, not the solution.\nThis essay contests the interpretation that after the 1936 election the New Deal concentrated on institutional reforms rather than on social reforms. The strong presidency built after the 1936 landslide victory was not simply a neutral nonpartisan institution; rather, Roosevelt remained the leader of a partisan government. Parties became increasingly national organizations for partisan politics between 1932-1948. The model of a neutral central administration of the 1950s was not inherited from the New Deal.\nThe conventional history of the franchise in the United States in its first century of democratic life is a narrative of inclusion and progress. The extension of voting rights, however, is only part of the story. Voting rights are important to define the legal preconditions to electoral participation, but they tell nothing about the social, cultural, political, and institutional processes by which eligible voters became actual voters, processes that were neither automatic nor irreversible. American democracy in the twentieth century stands witness to such reversibility. In the 1920s, exactly when eligibility qualifications had reached maximum expansion by the inclusion of women, electoral participation plummeted, producing the contemporary demobilized, class-skewed electorate. \u201cProgressive\u201d celebrations of suffrage enlargement conceal the fact that restrictive forces have always been active in American politics. Historically, the politics of exclusion have interacted with the politics of inclusion, with important effects on the shape of the electorate well before the turnout crisis of the 1920s. By then exclusion was so massive, and so socially stratified, that the United States was again a \u201crepublic of property owners\u201d, like at the historical and mythical beginning of its national history.\nFollowing a steady decline in turnout and partisanship, a dealignment thesis has replaced the realignment theory in the analysis of contemporary U.S. politics. The pursuit of white middle-class voters by both major parties has made them subdue policy differences, has insulated minorities from the decision-making process, and has encouraged the volatility of the partisan alignment in referendum-like elections by which a shrinking cohort of the eligible voters, unrepresentative of the broader society, confines itself to supporting or rejecting the record of the incumbent candidates.\nJ. Hillis Miller converses about the tasks that confront scholars in the current reshaping of the humanities in the US. The problems of having to shift from English to American literature as the center of national liberal education; the emergence of American studies and of the consciousness of difference; the current surge of cultural studies; are considered in the light of their meaning both in terms of teaching responsibility, and in terms of research instrumentalities and methodology. The new textual technologies brought about by CD-roms and audiovisual computer aids, or by computer archives, or by internet, are reflected upon in their connection with what seems to be an irreversible process of \u201cperipheralization\u201d of the humanities and of their canon in the American universities.\nThis paper discusses two poems by John Ashbery, \u201cParadoxes and Oxymorons\u201d and \u201cLight Turnouts\u201d, and the problems faced when translating them. After pointing out the differences in the three published versions of \u201cParadoxes and Oxymorons\u201d, its close resemblance to the last section of Whitman\u2019s \u201cSong of Myself\u201d is examined. Ashbery\u2019s poem\u2019s emphasis on the \u201cyou\u201d (both subject and object) is discussed in comparison with Whitman\u2019s focus on the \u201cI\u201d. \u201cLight Turnouts\u201d is examined in connection with Emily Dickinson\u2019s poem 670 (\u201cOne need not be a house...\u201d).\nIndirect representation of slavery in the works of Edgar Allan Poe is not limited to some obvious stagings of racial strife, such as that in Pym. Poe connects the question of the political acceptability of slavery with the Romantic rejection of traditional notions of literary mimesis. In texts dealing with the theme of failed imitation, the imitative gesture is an act of obedience at once required (from the slave) and blamable (in the artist). The slave\u2019s ability to repeat the master\u2019s gestures is either confirmed and indicted, or denied and punished. Special attention is given to The Murders in the Rue Morgue, Marginalia, Maelzel\u2019s Chess-Player, A Descent into the Maelstrom, The Raven, and William Wilson, each positing a different solution to the dilemmas of slavery."}, {"inputs": "I am very seriously considering taking RW's advice. Without upgrading to the not-free Movable Type 3.?, I will continue to fight the spam wars from a disadvantage. Those internal sever errors you get when you post a comment (and that we get when we add a post)? I'm sick of them. I think the Berkley database system, combined with a somewhat weak host server are the culprits. I could re-configure Movable Type to work with MySQL, but it would be hard, and what if it didn't work?\nSo, I've installed Wordpress 2.0.3 and I'm in the process, between working on my other projects, of installing the needed plugins, and going through the laborious proecess of reproducing the site themes. Meantime, I've registered a new URL, reflective of the fact that this site isn't just \"smijer\" any longer.\nI won't be porting all of the archives to WordPress. I see no point in it, and I don't wish to kill links to the old pages.

Peace activists will hold him up on their shoulders while Ann Coulter and company will be calling for him to be executed as a deserter. Joe Sixpack will maybe see him as a coward and be turned off toward peace efforts because the oganizers support Watada. And, at the end of the day, almost no one will debate whether a soldier has a right to refuse participation in a war he or she deems illegal.\nIf I'm in the Pentagon at this point, and am respectful of Watada's position, but worried about army discipline, I transfer him to a unit deploying to Afghanistan, where Watada has indicated he does not believe military action is/was illegal. But, that's a pragmatic solution, not an answer to the ethical dilemma. If a soldier cannot refuse orders on the basis Wataba claims, then \"following orders\" must become a valid defense in war crime trials. If he can, then we are left trusting the troops themselves to keep troop discipline without threat of court martial.\nMy gut says the latter is the preferable outcome, but like I said - it's a tough one. It would be interesting to hear reasoned thoughts from both sides of this emerging debate.\nand maybe a little flaky, but still thought-provoking, if only as a jumping off place.\nMuch more.

Senate Bill 2602 is intended to monetize previously captured carbon. The bill - sponsored by Senators John Barasso, R-Wyo.; Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va.; Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I.; and Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D. - appeals to both sides of the aisle.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a win-win. It\u2019s an energy bill. It\u2019s a carbon emission reduction bill and it will benefit all of us economically,\u201d said Capito.\nThe USE IT Act complements and builds off of recently-passed legislation that was introduced by the same bipartisan group of senators. The Furthering Carbon Capture, Utilization, Technology, Underground Storage, and Reduced Emissions (FUTURE) Act expanded and extended the Section 45Q tax credit for carbon capture.\n\u201cWe\u2019re now looking to the second phase and making sure that technology can make it out onto the field. Beyond economics, we need to have adequate R&D into CCUS (Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage),\u201d Capito said.\nUSE IT seeks to amend Section 103 of the Clean Air Act, adding language that accommodates carbon dioxide (CO2) activities. But critics say the move could be a threat to the Clean Air Act's integrity.\nThe hearing featured testimony from Mark Northam, executive director at the University of Wyoming\u2019s School of Energy Resources; S. Julio Friedmann, CEO of Carbon Wrangler LLC; Noah Deich, executive director at the Center for Carbon Removal; and Feng Jiao, associate professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering and associate director for the Center for Catalytic Science and Technology at the University of Delaware.\n\"In many ways, the U.S. has demonstrated prowess in fielding and managing CCUS infrastructure,\" Friedmann said. \"However, substantial shortcomings to these programs and infrastructure elements limit the market for greater uptake.\"\nThe existing CO2 pipelines are largely outdated, the great majority of them being built before 2003. Furthermore, those lines do not reach several key states necessary for transport. Senators discussed a need for expediting the pipeline permitting processes, which in one case took 54 months.\n\u201cObviously, if you\u2019re going to capture and utilize carbon dioxide, it\u2019s helpful to have a way to distribute it to the ultimate users. And that\u2019s where the pipeline piece comes in. It\u2019s a very sensible adjunct to the bill that we got passed,\u201d said Whitehouse.\nThe senators also talked about putting a price on the sales of stored carbon. The committee is looking to oil and coal stakeholders for input on the material's value. But since implementing carbon capture requires investments on the scale of billions of dollars, monetizing the stored carbon is a critical component of continuing the costly process.\n\"Carbon capture and sequestration process itself is not profitable without subsidies or carbon tax. As a critical component in CSUS, carbon utilization holds the key to generate revenues that can offset the capture cost and initial investments,\" Jiao said.\nWhile scientists hope to one day find a way to use the stored carbon as fuel for homes and vehicles, the option is not yet viable. Instead, they recommended using the material in applications such as building materials and chemicals. Many more uses are on the brink of discovery and call for further research. To facilitate those discoveries he USE IT Act directs the Environmental Protection Agency administrator to support CCUS research and development."}, {"inputs": "This is one of those things I've been meaning to make for ages, but never quite got round to it. I've been freezing my almost-stale bread for a while now in anticipation of it, but now I have an abundance of the stuff and I needed to make bread and butter pudding so that I could free up space in my freezer.\nI know people say this all the time, but it's surprising that adding custard ingredients and a few spices to bread can transform it into a really tasty and satisfying pudding. The number of ways in which you could vary this are never-ending, too. You could swap the raisins for chocolate chips, take the cocoa out of the custard mix to make a plain bread and butter pudding, add some mint for a mint chocolate pudding, add some peanut butter... or peanut butter and chocolate chips... maybe even spike it with something? That way, using up stale bread will never be boring, and you'll never feel like you have to make croutons (and let's be honest, how often are you going to eat those croutons?) again.\nIf I were you, I would find some stale bread (even fresh bread will do) and make some of this immediately. A hot, steaming pudding is the perfect remedy to a cold night, and there are plenty of those coming up. The recipe is based on the one from The Complete Book Of Baking by Carole Clements, but I tweaked it a bit to add a few more spices and the chocolate.\nPreheat the oven to 180C/160C and grease an oven proof dish.\nButter the bread and quarter the slices. Layer them over the bottom of the dish, sprinkling raisins between the layers.\nPut the double cream, milk, cocoa powder, eggs, sugar, nutmeg and cinnamon in a jug or mixing bowl and whisk until smooth. Pour over the bread slices and tuck in any bread that's sticking out. Leave to soak for 15 mins.\nBake in the oven for 30-40 mins, or until set.\nFor tips on how to make this pudding lower in calories, take a look at Healthy(ish) Baking.\nI'm entering this pudding into November's We Should Cocoa challenge. The challenge was started by Choclette of Chocolate Log Blog and Chele of Chocolate Teapot, and is hosted this month by Nazima of Franglais Kitchen. Nazima has chosen bread for this month's theme, so I suppose a pudding made of chocolate and bread fits in reasonably well.\nChocolate bread and butter pudding sounds like a perfect comfort bake to me. I was amused that you had frozen the perfectly stale bread for the pudding ready for the time you wanted to make it! very organised!"}]
