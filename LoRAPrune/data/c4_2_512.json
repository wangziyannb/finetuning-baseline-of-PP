It is simply not possible to win the jackpot without paying for a ticket or at least signing up for sweepstakes. Speaking of which, it is worth learning about the methods used by scam artists in order to be able to distinguish between genuine games and sweepstakes scams.\nThe very idea behind sweepstakes is that you are not required to pay a dime and honest organizers are particularly careful not to break the law. A clear sign of a scam is when players are asked to pay an entry fee or a fixed amount for claiming a prize they allegedly won in the previous draw. Sweepstakes scams are frequently using free email accounts despite claiming to represent big companies, an indicator that can help people recognize the fraud.\nAlthough players don\u2019t have to pay an entry fee, they need to enter a contest to have a chance of winning and there is no way of receiving a prize if you don\u2019t participate. Sweepstakes scams are built around the idea that a random person won a prize in this type of lottery game without even signing up, something that is simply not possible. Some try very hard to convince their potential victims about the fact that they are running a legitimate venture by sending bogus checks. Keep in mind that genuine sweepstakes will require confirmations before sending out a check for values that exceed $600.\nA genuine lottery or sweepstakes will not pressure players into doing anything hasty and will provide winners with plenty of time to act. Sweepstakes scams on the other hand are requiring the recipients to wire the money right away and inform them about the prospect of losing everything if they don\u2019t act quickly. This is a clear sign that you are dealing with scam artists who are trying to capitalize on your enthusiasm, so stay on alert and don\u2019t wire money, share personal details or credit card information.\nNot all sweepstakes scams are the same and some attempts are made by professionals, but the majority is poorly executed. The perpetrators don\u2019t know your name and that\u2019s why they use a general introductory formula such as \u201chello or dear Sir\u201d. Genuine lotteries will inform winners personally and when they resort to mail they use first-class services, so when presented with a winning notification sent by bookmakers it is only fair to assume that you\u2019re dealing with a sweepstakes scam. Last but not least, many scammers write in poor English and commit many grammar mistakes, something that a real lottery wouldn\u2019t do.\nCheck out How to identify and avoid lottery scams as well."}, {"inputs": "Summertimes in Roxburgh Park can be blistering!

Recent evidence indicates that Treg cells can adopt specialized differentiation programs in the periphery that are controlled by transcription factors usually associated with T helper differentiation. We demonstrate that expression of the transcription factor Blimp1 defines a population of Treg cells that localize predominantly to mucosal sites and produces IL-10. Blimp1 is required for IL-10 production by these cells and for their tissue homeostasis. A list of differentially expressed genes were identified from this whole-genome expression profiling experiment. Mouse Blimp1 +/gfp and Blimp1 gfp/gfp regulatory T cells were analyzed.

Overall design: Mouse Blimp1 +/gfp and Blimp1 gfp/gfp regulatory T cells were analyzed. Three replicates each.\nProject description:Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells restrict immune pathology in inflamed tissues; however, an inflammatory environment presents a threat to Treg cell identity and function. We here establish a transcriptional signature of central nervous system (CNS) Treg cells that accumulate during experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) and identify a pathway that maintains Treg cell function and identity during severe inflammation. This pathway was dependent on the transcriptional regulator Blimp1, which prevented dismantling of Foxp3 expression and \"toxic\" gain-of-function of Treg cells in the inflamed CNS. Blimp1 negatively regulated IL-6- and STAT3-mediated methylation of Treg cell-specific conserved non-coding sequence 2 (CNS2) in the Foxp3 locus. Consequently, CNS2 was heavily methylated when Blimp1 was ablated, leading to loss of Foxp3 expression and severe disease. These findings identify a Blimp1-dependent epigenetic pathway that preserves Treg cell stability in inflamed non-lymphoid tissues. Overall design: Comparison of DNA accessibility by Omni-ATAC-seq in conventional T cells (Tconv) and regulatory T cells (Treg) of wild-type vs Treg conditional Blimp1 deficient mice isolated from the CNS and spleen at the peak of experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE). All samples were FACS sorted ex vivo according to CD4+Foxp3(GFP)- = Tconv and CD4+Foxp3(GFP)+ = Treg from mixed bone morrow chimeras with congenically marked wild-type (CD45.1) and Treg conditional Blimp1 KO compartments (CD45.2).\nProject description:Antibody-secreting plasma cells are the terminal stage of the B-cell lineage. Plasma cell differentiation requires a major resetting of gene expression to silence the B cell transcriptional program, whilst establishing secretory function and long-term survival. The transcription factors Blimp1 and Irf4 are essential for the initial differentiation of activated B cells to antibody-secreting cells, however their function in mature plasma cells remains elusive. We have found that while Irf4 was essential for plasma cell survival, Blimp1 was dispensable. Blimp1-deficient cells retained the unique plasma cell transcriptional signature, but lost the ability to secrete antibody or to maintain the characteristic size and ultrastructure of plasma cells. Blimp1 was required for full expression of many components of the unfolded protein response (UPR), including Xbp1 and Atf6, as well as for the appropriate processing of Igh mRNA. The overlap of Blimp1 and Xbp1 function was restricted to the UPR genes, with Blimp1 uniquely regulating activity of the mTOR pathway, plasma cell size and morphology. These studies establish Blimp1 as a major regulator of the UPR pathway that is also required for the unique metabolic requirements of plasma cells enabling the secretion of protective antibody. RNA-seq was performed on wild type, Blimp1-/- and Xbp1-/- mouse plasma cells. Between two to four biological replicates were generated and sequenced for each sample.\nProject description:The transcriptional repressor BLIMP1 is a master regulator of B and T cell differentiation. To examine the role of BLIMP1 in innate immunity we used a conditional knockout (CKO) of Blimp1 in myeloid cells and found that Blimp1 CKO mice were protected from lethal infection induced by Listeria monocytogenes. Transcriptome analysis of Blimp1 CKO macrophages identified the murine chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 8, CCL8 as a direct target of Blimp1-mediated transcriptional repression in these cells. BLIMP1-deficient macrophages expressed elevated levels of Ccl8 and consequently Blimp1 CKO mice had higher levels of circulating CCL8 resulting in increased neutrophils in the peripheral blood, promoting a more aggressive anti-bacterial response. Mice lacking the Ccl8 gene were more susceptible to L. monocytogenes infection than wild type mice. While CCL8 failed to recruit neutrophils directly, it was chemotactic for \u03b3/\u03b4 T cells and CCL8-responsive \u03b3/\u03b4 T cells were enriched for IL-17F. Finally, CCL8-mediated enhanced clearance of L. monocytogenes was dependent on \u03b3/\u03b4 T cells. Collectively, these data reveal an important role for BLIMP1 in modulating host-defenses by suppressing expression of the chemokine CCL8. RNA (5\u03bcg) was isolated from WT and Blimp1 CKO BMDM untreated or infected for 2 hours with L.monocytogenes (MOI=5). Three biological replicates were performed for each experimental condition. The gene chip mouse genome 430 2.0 Array (Affymetrix) was used. Biological replicates were normalized using the GCRMA method and analyzed using various Bioconductor tools.\nProject description:The mechanisms of transcriptional regulation underlying human primordial germ cell differentiation are largely unknown. Transcriptional repressor Prdm1/Blimp1 is known to play a critical role in controlling germ cell specification in mice. We show that ectopic expression of PRDM1 in hESCs promotes the generation of cells exhibiting transcriptomic features of early primordial germ cells. Overall design: To consolidate if hESCs expressing ectopic GFP-PRDM1 displayed gene expression signature similar to that in germline lineage, we compared the transcription profiles of H9 hESCs transduced with GFP-PRDM1 and GFP control vectors on days 7 and 17."}, {"inputs": "The event comes with new skins and starts February 8, but has no concrete end date.\nLike every \"Overwatch\" special event, Blizzard has designed special skins available via loot boxes in-game. According to Blizzard's official Lunar New Year page, there are 50 new seasonal items available this year, including legendary skins like Black Lily Windowmaker and Xuanwu Zarya, among others. In addition, skins and gear from last Lunar New Year are available for purchase at a reduced credit cost.\n\"Overwatch\" has announced gameplay changes to its Capture the Flag mode. Flag pickup is instant, but you cannot pick up flags until 5 seconds after they are dropped. Flag returns take 4 seconds, which aren't interrupted by taking damage. According to the official page, mobility and invulnerability moves drop the flag, and music plays while you carry it around the map! When the round starts over, the flags are moved closer to the center, and the first team to capture wins. All these changes will apply to older maps as well.\nThis new capture the flag map is based on a real place in Thailand. Be sure to check it out.\nIn addition to amazing and beautiful skins, there are new highlight intros and emotes for certain heroes in the game. McCree, Tracer, Fortune, and Roadhog all have new highlight intros. In addition to these heroes (minus Tracer and Fortune), Doomfist, D.va, Mei, and Junkrat have new emotes to try out.\nConsidering there is so much loot and so many things to try out, it might be overwhelming to someone who is new.\nPlay as much as you can: this is to ensure you can grab as many free skins as possible so you can snag the ones for heroes you love. The more you play, the better your chances.\nDon't be discouraged: it is frustrating to open lootbox after lootbox and still not get the skin you want. It's okay, the chance for you to get your desired skin is high if you are regular with your playtime.\nTry your hardest: even if you die a lot, pat yourself on the back, stretch a bit, and grab something to drink or eat.\nObserve your favorite players: \"Overwatch\" pros have a lot of tips and tricks to up your game and improve your skills.\nHave fun: this is a game, after all. Don't be too hard on yourself."}]
