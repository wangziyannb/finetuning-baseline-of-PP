[{"inputs": "This lab will introduce you the binary instrumentation technique, in the context of a tool called zookie. You will develop zookie on top of the DynamoRIO platform, to prevent buffer overflow exploits of the zookws web server from the previous lab. The zookie tool enforces control-flow integrity, that is, the runtime execution of zookws must follow a static control-flow graph determined ahead of time. You will also implement shadow stack in zookie to make zookws resist buffer overflow exploits.\nBranch lab2 set up to track remote branch lab2 from origin.\nIn the first part, you will implement a version of zookie that enforces control-flow integrity. The goal will be to prevent an adversary from taking control of program execution through buffer overflows that corrupt a return address or function pointer. You can assume that the attacker cannot modify the program's code by exploiting buffer overflows. Thus, we only need to consider indirect branch instructions for this part of the lab, since the adversary has no way of changing the target addresses of direct branch instructions.\nTo determine the set of legitimate control flow transitions in a program (like our web server), we will profile a normal execution of that program, when it is processing \"expected\" requests, and no attack is taking place. Once the set of legal control flow transitions has been recorded, we will switch zookie into enforcement mode, where it will check that every indirect control flow transfer is a legal one (i.e., it matches one of the previously-recorded jumps). If not, we will assume that an attack is taking place, and abort execution to ensure that the program is not compromised.\n+ cd -P -- .\nTo understand how this profiling works, look at the source code in zookie.c. The dr_init function is invoked by the DynamoRIO runtime when it first starts. This function looks at the opt variable to determine the options passed to it by the shell script; if the -p option is passed, it goes into profiling mode, and otherwise, it goes into enforcement mode. Finally, dr_init calls dr_register_bb_event, a function provided by DynamoRIO, to register our own function that should be called to instrument every basic block in the program.\nWhenever dr_register_bb_event is called by DynamoRIO, it traverses all of the instructions in the basic block, and, if the instruction is a multi-way branch (instr_is_mbr), we call dr_insert_mbr_instrumentation to tell DynamoRIO to invoke our function (either profile_at_mbr or enforce_at_mbr) at that instruction. These functions, in turn, will either record the branch taken, or enforce our control flow graph, respectively. The output you see when running ./run-profile.sh on the initial lab 2 code is being printed by profile_at_mbr, in particular.\nYou can learn more about DynamoRIO by looking at the DynamoRIO documentation. For example, look at the documentation for the functions we mentioned above, such as dr_register_bb_event, instr_is_mbr, and dr_insert_mbr_instrumentation.\nExercise 1. Implement the profiling mode for zookie, by recording all indirect control flow transfers into a log file. You get to design your own log file format for this exercise. Check that your web server works in profiling mode, and that your logging code appears to be recording all indirect control flow transfers.\nNote that zookie follows the child processes spawned by zookld, and instruments each of them in turn. In the code we have provided, zookie creates a new log file for the the execution of each process, named progname.pid.log. In profile_at_mbr, you can use cfg_log to access the log file for the currently running process. After you have run ./run-profile.sh, you should end up with several log files, including one for zookd and one for zookfs.\nNow that you have recorded all indirect control flow transfers, you will need to compute a control-flow graph based on these log entries, and to implement the enforcement part of zookie, namely, checking that all indirect control flow transfers at runtime match the recorded control flow graph.\nSecond, implement the enforcement mode of zookie, by loading your control flow graph when zookie starts (see function enforce_init), and checking the control flow graph at every indirect control flow transfer (in enforce_at_mbr). Be sure to print a string starting with zookie: Invalid branch, using dr_fprintf(STDERR, ...) when you catch an invalid branch in enforce_at_mbr; this is how our grading script will check your code.\nTo check that your code works, first run it in profiling mode, to generate an expected call graph, then run ./merge.py, and then run ./run-enforce.sh to run zookie in enforcement mode. You will want to try to cover all code paths in the web server when browsing the web site in profiling mode; otherwise, enforcement mode may report false alarms due to incomplete control-flow graphs.\nTo verify that your code meets our grading standards, you can use the grading script ./grade-lab2-part1.sh.\nSubmit your answers to this part of the lab assignment by running make handin, and upload the resulting lab2-handin.tar.gz file at http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/cgi-bin/858handin.\nOne downside of current zookie implementation is that it requires a precise and complete control flow graph to be computed ahead of time. If you forgot to exercise some part of your web server during the profiling phase (such as requesting a non-existent file), the new control flow associated with that code can lead to a false positive at enforcement time, and kill your server when no attack was taking place.\nIn this exercise, we will consider an alternative approach to protecting the web server from buffer overflow exploits, which requires no training or profiling execution ahead of time, but that is a little less precise. In particular, we will try to prevent overwrites of return addresses on the stack, by remembering the locations of return addresses on the stack, and preventing other memory writes to those locations. Of course, this approach will not be able to prevent function pointer overwrites, but it will be easier to use (i.e., no profiling required).\nTo enforce this return address protection scheme, we will need to perform three steps. First, we will need to remember the location of all return addresses placed on the stack, by intercepting call instructions, and remembering where they wrote the return address. Second, we will need to intercept all other memory writes, and ensure that they do not write to a memory location previously used by a call instruction to save the return address. Third, we will need to clean up these protected memory locations once the function returns, by intercepting instructions that might remove values from the stack, such as pop and ret.\nExercise 3. Implement the stack return address protection scheme described above, in zookie.c. We have provided hooks that intercept all memory writes (look at enforce_mem_write). This function gets called for both call instructions (which themselves generate a memory write, by storing the return address on the stack), and for other instructions that write to memory. You will need to devise your own data structure to store the list of protected locations on the stack. You will also need to also intercept other instructions to clean up return address locations in your data structures after they have been popped off the stack.\nTo test whether your code works, you can invoke zookie in stack-checking mode by running ./run-stackcheck.sh. You should first ensure that you can access the web server normally, and then check that buffer overflows that corrupt the return address are caught.\nYou can run our grading script, ./grade-lab2-part2.sh, as well. Be sure to print a string starting with zookie: Return overwrite, using dr_fprintf(STDERR, ...) when you catch a memory write to a return address in enforce_mem_write; this is how our grading script will check your code.\nChallenge! For extra credit, optimize the memory write checks from Exercise 3, by doing binary rewriting instead of using dr_insert_clean_call. Look at dr/samples/memtrace.c for an example of how you might do it.\nYou are done! Run make handin and follow instructions to upload the resulting file."}, {"inputs": "Today\u2019s guest blog comes from Abby Stone and Becca Riley. Abby Stone is the Stranding Coordinator, and Becca Riley is the Senior Sea Turtle & Aquatics Biologist at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium in Clearwater, Florida.\nHere at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium, we respond to strandings of marine mammals, sea turtles and river otters. Volunteer stranding networks like ours can be found in every coastal state in the U.S., and we work closely with our partners to provide emergency aid to distressed marine animals so that they may have their best chance at survival.\nLet\u2019s talk about sea turtles: our work with these incredible animals encompasses every aspect of their life cycle, from protecting local sea turtle nests and responding to stranding calls, to successfully rehabilitating hundreds of sea turtles we receive in our facility each year. Clearwater Marine Aquarium also provides a forever home for wildlife deemed non-releasable by veterinarians and our governing agency, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The aquarium is currently home to 10 resident sea turtles that were impacted by human interaction. They now serve as ambassadors to educate aquarium guests on the impacts people have on our marine ecosystems.\nClearwater Marine Aquarium is on the front lines of protecting sea turtles for future generations. The stranding and nesting information we collect and report to our governing agencies feeds into broader efforts to analyze the data and develop an understanding of the current and projected status of these endangered animals.\nNone of the work of the aquarium\u2019s rescue team or sea turtle department would be possible without guidance and funding from National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS), a branch of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). For example, research funded by NOAA\u2019s prestigious John G. Prescott Grant Program continues to support marine mammal research nationwide and makes essential stranding resources available to stranding network partners such as equipment, services, professional training and information.\nFurthermore, NOAA\u2019s Marine Mammal Unusual Mortality Event funding supports efforts to examine carcasses and live animals to better understand the causes and factors that may be involved with unusually high mortality rates. This funding is critical for tackling these especially challenging situations, along with coordination provided by NOAA when we are orchestrating responses to large-scale events like dolphin disentanglements and mass strandings with other aquariums and partners.\nAny loss in resources for NOAA would create a sweeping negative impact, both internally within the aquarium and for our partners. Budget cuts would hamper the overall mission of understanding changes in the environment, sharing knowledge and information, and conserving marine ecosystems. If NOAA was not able to provide funding to partners of the National Marine Mammal Stranding Networks specifically, we would not be able to conduct further research or serve as the ocean first responders to stranding of sea turtles and other marine life.\nWe aim to see sea turtle populations restored to a healthy size worldwide and reduce the amount of human interaction that negatively affects them. Those are big goals, but with everyone working together towards the solution\u2014and with support from NOAA\u2014we can make a significant impact and hopefully save sea turtles from extinction."}, {"inputs": "The city of Gao was left badly damaged during the conflict between Malian forces and the Tuareg-led Islamist group last year.\nChristians in a city in northern Mali, already forced to hold services in a school classroom because their church was looted and not ready to host meetings, had a bomb scare on Sunday (Jan. 12).\nMilitary personnel patrolling the area in Gao on Sunday morning discovered explosives near the school.

When it arrived at our Los Angeles wildlife center we found thick wads of monofilament line constricting both legs, with yet more line around its neck. Fortunately, the leg injuries appeared mild, compared to other cases like this we have treated, but the neck wounds were very bad and warranted immediate surgery.\nThis wound shows the seriousness that birds face with discarded fishing line.\nOur staff immediately anesthetized the bird to remove the line from the neck. Under the line, our staff veterinarian, Dr. Rebecca Duerr, found deep lacerations encircling the whole neck. The damage was limited to the skin. Thankfully, the esophagus and trachea appeared undamaged. She removed some areas of dead skin and sutured the skin back together.\nThe bird had obviously been trying to eat since its esophagus was packed with a hard dry ball of green grass that it couldn\u2019t swallow.\nWe have hopes this goose will make a full recovery.

In terms of measuring the growth of the DotNetNuke project, we had traditionally monitored the total number of registered users on the dotnetnuke.com web site, the number of new users per month, and the number of downloads per month. These metrics revealed some definite trends but were rather myopic in terms of providing a relative comparison to other open source or commercial products. As a result, we looked for some other indicators that we could use to measure our overall market impact.\nAlexa is a free service provided by Amazon that can be used to judge the popularity of an Internet web site. Popularity is an interesting metric because traffic distribution on the Internet conforms to a 90/10 rule: 10% of web sites account for 90% of the overall traffic, and 90% of web sites share the other 10%. This logarithmic scale means that it gets progressively more difficult to make substantial gains in your Alexa ranking as your web site popularity increases. Although the Alexa ranking is not a conventional progress indicator, we decided to use it as one of our key progress indicators (KPI) in determining the impact of our marketing efforts. The dotnetnuke.com web site had an Alexa ranking of 19,000 in April 2005.\nSourceForge is the world's largest development and download repository of open source code and applications. Early in its project history, DotNetNuke had established a presence on SourceForge.Net (http://sourceforge.net/projects/dnn as shown in Figure 1-10) and continued to leverage its mirrored download infrastructure and bandwidth for hosting all project release packages. Because SourceForge.Net contained listings for all of largest and most successful open source projects in existence, it also provided a variety of comparison and ranking statistics that could be used to judge activity and popularity. This seemed to be another good KPI to measure our impact in the open source realm. In April 2005, the DotNetNuke project had an overall project ranking of 1,271.\nOne of the items that had been neglected over the life of the project was the dotnetnuke.com web site. It had long been a goal to build this asset into a content-rich communication hub for the DotNetNuke community. Patrick Santry made some early progress in this area but recently found his volunteer time diminishing due to personal and family commitments. Because a web site is largely an extension of product marketing (another function that had long been ignored) the dotnetnuke.com web site suffered from sparse content, poor organization, and inconsistent focus. After the release of DotNetNuke 3.0, a significant effort was invested in improving all aspects of the web site. Much of the initial improvements came as a result of evaluating web sites of other open source projects. After extensive deliberation, we decided to organize the site information into three functional areas: user-oriented information, community collaboration, and developer information. New \"sticky\" content areas were added for project news and community events. The Home Page was completely revamped to provide summary marketing information and project metrics.\nIn March 2005, another significant milestone occurred in DotNetNuke history. Dan Egan, a passionate DotNetNuke community member, wrote a book for PackT Publishing entitled Building Websites with VB.NET and DotNetNuke 3.0. This was the first book published about DotNetNuke and was essential in proving the demand for the product, paving the way for future DotNetNuke books from a variety of other publishers. In addition, a handful of Core Team members, including me, were also collaborating on a book for WROX Press during this time frame, but the demands of getting the DotNetNuke 3.0 product ready for release forced us to slip the publication date. Regardless, any technical content that makes it to mass publication through traditional channels lends an incredible amount of credibility and equity to the project or technology for which it is written. In addition, books can have a positive marketing impact; especially if they reach wide circulation through online retailers and brick-and-mortar bookstores.\nIn May of 2005, Core Team member Jim Duffy was successful in securing a DotNetNuke session on DotNetRocks!, an Internet radio talk show hosted by Carl Franklin and Richard Campbell. This was our second appearance on the show (the first being in August of 2004), and it was a lot of fun to talk about DotNetNuke in such a relaxed and open atmosphere. The show focused on the recent DotNetNuke 3.0 release and proved to be great way to promote some of the incredible new application features. It is hard to estimate the impact of the appearance on the DotNetRocks! show, but it certainly made me a firm believer in the benefits of podcasting as a powerful broad distribution marketing medium."}, {"inputs": "You can check out the repository on Github or get the image from Docker Hub.\nThe following docker-compose.yml is useful when testing local SIP clients, and smaller installs (the main limiting factor here being the RTP port range size).\nDepending on your call volume, you may need to have more RTP ports setup, or reduce the load due to forwarding ports into the container\u2019s bridge network. A pretty typical setup has 10k ports in a range 10000-20000, and with the current Docker implementation this is impossible to do efficiently.\nTo achieve this, you can use \"host\" network mode.\nWith no port forwards, ensure that your configuration only binds to IP\u2019s and ports that are necessary (e.g. if you have multiple Asterisk containers, config files must not have 0.0.0.0 in them).\nBy default, Asterisk is configured heavily through configuration files. The image comes with the default configuration files from the Asterisk source code. You can extract the sample configurations (and data directories) by binding your local folders into different directories for a single run. So swap out the volumes in one of the above `docker-compose.yml` files for these.\nAnd then run `docker-compose run --rm asterisk bash -c \u201ccp -R /etc/asterisk/* /ic && cp -R /var/lib/asterisk/* /id && cp -R /var/spool/asterisk/* /ids\u201d` . This will get you in a good starting point to start your specific customizations.\nAt the bare minimum, you will want to spend time in the following files.\nextensions.conf : Setup your dialplan contexts.\nsip.conf or pjsip.conf : Setup the addresses and ports where SIP clients and trunks will communicate with your server.\nIf you plan on sending mail (e.g. sending a user their voicemail), you will need to provide some way for Asterisk to send mail. Asterisk uses `/etc/sbin/sendmail` to do this (and appears to be hardcoded to do so). Given this is docker, we don\u2019t want Postfix or some other MTA running in the server. Instead, I have installed and symlinked msmtp to that location. All you need to do is provide msmtp a configuration file at `/etc/msmtprc`, and msmtp will send your mail out by connecting to a SMTP server of your choice (e.g. smtp.gmail.com or smtp.mandrillapp.com).\nFor more information check out the msmtp project and documentation.\nAsterisk has two \u2018data like\u2019 folders, one at `/var/lib/asterisk` which holds media files that are commonly used to play sounds and greetings to people, as well as storing on hold music. Typically you will record custom greetings into a path in this folder as well. It is possible to use the defaults inside the image and instead mount a custom recording directory inside of the sounds directory.\nNote, if you try to record into something like \u2018custom/greeting\u2019, Asterisk will not create the folder for you, so make sure the folder exists beforehand.\nThe next data directory is at `/var/spool/asterisk` where call recordings and voicemail lives.\nOne of the main reasons I wanted to do this was to be able to use the existing integration inside of Odoo Enterprise to enable a sales user to call leads in a sequential list using only their browser.\nThis leads to challenges beyond the typical Asterisk use cases requiring both Websockets (http.conf) to be configured, as well as special options for the dialing peers (sip.conf/pjsip.conf). Odoo\u2019s documentation will help here, just keep in mind that you will not be able to use the same SIP peer for a deskphone and WebRTC. Additionally, if you are running Odoo on SSL then you need even more work to get WSS and SRTP configured and working.\nNote that the current version of Odoo\u2019s sip.js is a little out of date, and has some issues communicating with PJSIP. Using sip.js version 0.7.7 release instead has gotten me the best results so far.\nBrowser support is a mixed bag here, currently I have outgoing calls working with modern Safari (Technology Preview Release 33 (Safari 11.0, WebKit 12604.1.25.0.2)), Firefox (53.0.3), and Chrome (58.0.3029.110).\nHowever, both Safari and Firefox cannot receive calls. They start, but when you accept the call in the browser, Asterisk immediately returns from the Dial with NOANSWER.\nWhile this implementation is not perfect, I will continue looking into what can be done to improve upon this with newer versions of SIP.js and other settings changes.\nIf you have any Asterisk or WebRTC tips or questions, please drop me a line or comment below."}, {"inputs": "We know a lot about the NotPetya malware, including how it spreads and its functionality. It was highly sophisticated, spread quickly, and caused harm. In this blog, I share more about lessons learned from the incident.\nThe global NotPetya malware incident that affected us and thousands of other organizations worldwide was unprecedented. It was highly sophisticated, spread quickly, and caused harm.\nUnderstandably, it also created a lot of confusion. Some initial media accounts were inaccurate and misconceptions about the incident continue to spread. That kind of uncertainty can create fear.\nThe key to combating that fear is knowledge. To that end, I\u2019d like to share more about lessons learned from the NotPetya malware incident, to reduce uncertainty and help our clients feel confident in our systems going forward.\nWe know a lot about the NotPetya malware, including how it spreads and its functionality. We have compared the behaviors we have seen on our internal network with extensive research performed by the security community and the Department of Homeland Security (US-CERT).\nNotPetya is not ransomware, as was initially reported by the media. NotPetya does not provide a legitimate method for decrypting files in exchange for paying a ransom.\nPatches alone were not able to stop NotPetya. Unlike some malware, patching alone would not have stopped the propagation of NotPetya. The malware also can spread via compromised credentials through two inherent windows management and administration tools that are active even on fully patched systems.\nNotPetya does not spread by email, by email attachments or by infecting other files. Research confirms that the malware does not have this capability.\nRest assured that we are putting this knowledge into action. We are enhancing our security against similar future incidents, including hardening the security configurations of endpoints, deploying advanced endpoint prevention and detection software, and enhancing network security measures. In short, we upgraded our network architecture and IT policies as part of the recovery efforts to ensure we emerged from this incident with an enhanced, secure operating environment.\nI know that our clients place a great deal of trust in our teams and our solutions, and we are working to earn that confidence every day. We also are committed to continuing to share the hard-won lessons we have learned from this situation."}, {"inputs": "Broadsword is fully equipped to comply with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency's Code of Practice for the Certification of Small Vessels.\nIt sleeps up to 6 guests in 3 cabins plus skipper and crew in the saloon.\nFor daytime charter the vessel is coded for up to 8 guests.\nJeanneau Yachts have been building superior sailing yachts for over 50 years.
